    "This paper is about Opinion Mining, in the paper Irsoy and Cardie describe opinion mining as. \"Fine-grained opinion analysis aims to detect subjective expressions in a text (e.g. \"hate\") and to characterize their intensity (e.g. strong) and sentiment (e.g. negative)\" (Irsoy and Cardie, 2014). Opinion mining is related to areas of computer science such as natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics. The goal of opinion mining, is to take an input sentence then output information describing the subjective expressions, intensity and sentiment.\n",
    "The authors achieve this by feeding a sentences into machine learning algorithms in an attempt to classify the sentences into either *direct subjective expressions* (DSEs) or *expressive subjective expressions* (ESEs) (Wiebe et al., 2005).\n",
    "\"DSE's consist of private states or speech events expressing private states; and ESE's consist of expressions that indicate sentiment, emotion, etc., without explicitly conveying them\" (Isroy and Cardie, 2014). In the past, opinion mining problems have been attempted to be solved as sequence labeling problems for example in the work of (Choi et al., 2005). To utilize research that has been undertaken in the past Isroy and Cardie used the BIO tagging scheme. The BIO tagging scheme is a simple tagging system where the B indicates the beginning of the of an opinion related expression, I corresponds to all of the tokens inside the opinion related expression, and the O indicates tokens outside any opinion related class. Below is the example provided in the paper.  \n",
